# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical bug in the role invitation acceptance functionality where the system attempts to reference a non-existent `country_id` column in the `profile_roles` table, causing invitation acceptance to fail with a PostgreSQL error. The system should properly use the existing `authority_id` column instead of the missing `country_id` column.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has been invited to a role, I want to be able to accept my invitation successfully, so that I can gain access to the system with the appropriate permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to accept a role invitation THEN the system SHALL successfully create a profile_roles record using the authority_id column
2. WHEN the invitation acceptance process executes THEN the system SHALL NOT attempt to reference a country_id column in the profile_roles table
3. WHEN a profile_roles record is created THEN the system SHALL use the authority_id from the role_invitation record
4. WHEN the invitation acceptance completes successfully THEN the user SHALL be granted the appropriate role permissions within the specified authority

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the invitation acceptance code to use the correct database schema, so that the system operates reliably without database errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the invitation acceptance code executes THEN the system SHALL only reference columns that exist in the profile_roles table schema
2. WHEN creating a profile_roles record THEN the system SHALL map the authority_id from the role_invitation to the profile_roles.authority_id field
3. WHEN the database operation executes THEN the system SHALL NOT generate PostgreSQL column not found errors
4. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN all database column references SHALL match the actual schema structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling for invitation acceptance, so that users receive clear feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invitation acceptance fails due to database errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the user
2. WHEN invitation acceptance succeeds THEN the system SHALL confirm successful role assignment to the user
3. WHEN database constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user
4. WHEN invitation acceptance is attempted with invalid data THEN the system SHALL validate inputs before attempting database operations
