# Complete Movement History Setup

## Problem
Pass Movement History was only showing border control movements (check_in, check_out) but not local authority scans.

## Solution
I've updated both the database functions and the Flutter app to show ALL movement types:

### 1. Border Control Movements
- ‚úÖ Check-In (green login icon)
- ‚úÖ Check-Out (blue logout icon)

### 2. Local Authority Scans
- ‚úÖ Routine Check (orange verified icon)
- ‚úÖ Roadblock (orange verified icon)
- ‚úÖ Investigation (orange verified icon)
- ‚úÖ Compliance Audit (orange verified icon)

## Files to Apply

### 1. Database Function (Required)
**File**: `create_complete_movement_history_function.sql`

This creates the database functions that return ALL movements including local authority scans.

### 2. Flutter App Updates (Already Applied)
**File**: `lib/services/enhanced_border_service.dart` - Updated PassMovement class
**File**: `lib/screens/authority_validation_screen.dart` - Updated UI display

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Run Database Function
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
create_complete_movement_history_function.sql
```

### Step 2: Restart Your App
The Dart code changes are already applied, just restart your Flutter app.

## Movement Types & Icons

| Movement Type | Icon | Color | Description |
|---------------|------|-------|-------------|
| `check_in` | üîì login | Green | Vehicle entered country |
| `check_out` | üîí logout | Blue | Vehicle exited country |
| `local_authority_scan` | üõ°Ô∏è verified_user | Orange | Authority scan/check |

## Database Functions Created

### 1. get_pass_movement_history(pass_id)
Returns complete movement history with these fields:
- movement_id, border_name, official_name
- movement_type, latitude, longitude
- processed_at, entries_deducted
- previous_status, new_status
- scan_purpose, notes, authority_type

### 2. get_pass_history(pass_id)
Alternative name for compatibility - same functionality.

## Enhanced PassMovement Class

The Flutter `PassMovement` class now includes:
```dart
class PassMovement {
  // Existing fields...
  final String? scanPurpose;    // NEW: For local authority scans
  final String? notes;          // NEW: Scan notes
  final String? authorityType;  // NEW: border_official or local_authority
  
  // NEW: Helper methods
  bool get isBorderMovement;
  bool get isLocalAuthorityScan;
  String get actionDescription; // Handles all movement types
}
```

## UI Enhancements

### Movement History Display
- ‚úÖ Different icons for each movement type
- ‚úÖ Color coding (green/blue/orange)
- ‚úÖ Shows scan purpose for local authority scans
- ‚úÖ Shows notes when available
- ‚úÖ Proper text formatting for each type

### Example Display

## Verification

After applying the database function, test it:

```sql
-- Check if functions exist
SELECT 
    p.proname as function_name,
    pg_get_function_arguments(p.oid) as arguments
FROM pg_proc p
JOIN pg_namespace n ON p.pronamespace = n.oid
WHERE p.proname IN ('get_pass_movement_history', 'get_pass_history')
AND n.nspname = 'public';
```

Expected: 2 functions should be listed.

```sql
-- Test with a real pass ID
SELECT * FROM get_pass_movement_history('your-pass-id-here');
```

Expected: Should return both border movements AND local authority scans.

## Summary

‚úÖ **Database**: Functions return ALL movement types  
‚úÖ **Flutter**: PassMovement class enhanced with new fields  
‚úÖ **UI**: Different icons and colors for each movement type  
‚úÖ **Display**: Shows scan purpose and notes for local authority scans  
‚úÖ **Complete**: Now shows full movement history including local authority scans

Just run the database function and restart your app!
