# Distance Calculation Fix

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

The heat map was showing incorrect distances (0.5km) for scan locations that were actually hundreds of kilometers from the border. Looking at the map, scans near Johannesburg were incorrectly labeled as being only 0.5km from the Ngwenya Border.

## Root Cause üîç

In `lib/services/border_officials_service_simple.dart`, the `_generateRealScanLocations` method was using hardcoded mock values:

```dart
// BEFORE (incorrect)
distanceFromBorderKm: 0.5, // Mock distance
isOutlier: false,
borderName: 'Border Checkpoint',
```

## Solution Implemented üõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Real Distance Calculation
- **Fetch Border Coordinates**: Query the `borders` table to get actual border lat/lng
- **Haversine Formula**: Calculate real distance between scan location and border
- **Accurate Outlier Detection**: Mark scans >5km from border as outliers

### 2. Enhanced Data Processing
```dart
// AFTER (accurate)
// Calculate real distance using Haversine formula
distanceFromBorderKm = _calculateDistance(
  latitude, longitude, 
  borderLat, borderLng
);

// Mark as outlier if more than 5km from border
isOutlier = distanceFromBorderKm > 5.0;
```

### 3. Added Distance Calculation Functions
- `_calculateDistance()`: Haversine formula for accurate geographic distance
- `_degreesToRadians()`: Helper function for coordinate conversion

## Expected Results üéØ

After this fix, you should see:

### Accurate Distances
- **Johannesburg scans**: ~300km from Ngwenya Border (marked as outliers)
- **Near-border scans**: Actual distances in km
- **Outlier detection**: Red markers for scans >5km from border

### Visual Improvements
- **Red markers**: For scans far from border (security concerns)
- **Green markers**: For scans near border (normal operations)
- **Accurate data table**: Correct distances in sortable table

### Security Benefits
- **Real outlier detection**: Identify actual suspicious scan locations
- **Geographic context**: Understand true spatial distribution of activities
- **Compliance monitoring**: Verify officials are scanning in appropriate areas

## Technical Details üìä

### Haversine Formula
Calculates the shortest distance between two points on Earth's surface:
- Accounts for Earth's curvature
- Accurate for distances up to ~1000km
- Returns distance in kilometers

### Database Queries
- Fetches border coordinates from `borders` table
- Matches scan `border_id` with actual border locations
- Handles missing coordinate data gracefully

### Performance
- Efficient batch queries for border data
- Minimal additional database calls
- Cached border coordinates for multiple scans

## Testing üß™

To verify the fix:

1. **Refresh the application** to reload with new distance calculations
2. **Check scan locations** - distances should now be accurate
3. **Look for red markers** - scans far from border should be marked as outliers
4. **Use the data table** - sort by distance to see the range of values

The heat map should now provide accurate geographic intelligence for border security analysis! üó∫Ô∏è
