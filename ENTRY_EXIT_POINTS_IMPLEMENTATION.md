# Entry/Exit Points Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Function Fix
- **File**: `supabase_fix_authority_name.sql`
- **Issue**: The `get_pass_templates_for_authority` function was not returning `authority_name`, causing "Unknown Authority" errors
- **Fix**: Updated function to include `authority_name` field by joining with the `authorities` table
- **Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS TO BE EXECUTED** - Run this SQL script when database is available

### 2. Pass Template Management Screen Updates
- **File**: `lib/screens/pass_template_management_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Moved "Allow users to select entry/exit points" checkbox above entry/exit point dropdowns
  - When checkbox is checked (true):
    - Entry/exit point dropdowns are hidden
    - Entry point is automatically set to first available border (not null)
    - Exit point is cleared
  - When checkbox is unchecked (false):
    - Entry/exit point dropdowns are shown
    - Users can select specific entry/exit points for the template
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 3. Pass Dashboard Screen Updates
- **File**: `lib/screens/pass_dashboard_screen.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added state variables for user-selected entry/exit points
  - Added `_loadBordersForTemplate()` method to load available borders when template allows user selection
  - Updated template selection to load borders when `allowUserSelectablePoints` is true
  - Added entry/exit point selection dropdowns in pass details section
  - Updated purchase validation to require entry/exit point selection when template allows it
  - Updated summary display to show selected entry/exit points
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 4. Pass Service Updates
- **File**: `lib/services/pass_service.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `getBordersForAuthority()` method to fetch borders for user selection
  - Updated `issuePassFromTemplate()` method to accept user-selected entry/exit point parameters
  - Modified pass creation logic to use user-selected points when provided
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Functionality Implemented

### Create Pass Template
1. **Checkbox Position**: "Allow users to select entry/exit points" checkbox is now above entry/exit point dropdowns
2. **Conditional Display**: 
   - If checkbox is **checked**: Entry/exit dropdowns are hidden, entry point set to first available border
   - If checkbox is **unchecked**: Entry/exit dropdowns are shown for admin selection

### Select Pass Template
1. **Fixed Entry/Exit Points** (allowUserSelectablePoints = false):
   - Display entry/exit points as set in template
   - No user selection required
2. **User-Selectable Points** (allowUserSelectablePoints = true):
   - Load available borders for the authority
   - Show entry point dropdown (required, no null option)
   - Show exit point dropdown (required, no null option)
   - Validate that both points are selected before allowing purchase

### Purchase Validation
- Templates with fixed points: No additional validation needed
- Templates with user-selectable points: Both entry and exit points must be selected

## Database Requirements

The following SQL script needs to be executed to fix the "Unknown Authority" error:

```sql
-- Run supabase_fix_authority_name.sql
-- This adds authority_name to the get_pass_templates_for_authority function
```

## Testing Checklist

### Pass Template Management
- [ ] Create template with checkbox unchecked - should show entry/exit dropdowns
- [ ] Create template with checkbox checked - should hide entry/exit dropdowns
- [ ] Verify checkbox state affects form display correctly
- [ ] Verify template creation works with both settings

### Pass Selection & Purchase
- [ ] Select template with fixed entry/exit points - should display points, no selection needed
- [ ] Select template with user-selectable points - should show selection dropdowns
- [ ] Verify entry/exit point selection is required for user-selectable templates
- [ ] Verify purchase works with user-selected points
- [ ] Verify "Unknown Authority" error is resolved after database update

### Database Function
- [ ] Execute `supabase_fix_authority_name.sql` when database is available
- [ ] Verify pass templates show correct authority names instead of "Unknown Authority"

## Notes

1. **Database Connection**: The database function fix couldn't be applied due to Docker/Supabase not running locally
2. **Validation**: Entry/exit point selection validation ensures no null values are allowed when user selection is enabled
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing templates with fixed entry/exit points continue to work as before
4. **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback shows when user selection is required vs. when points are pre-defined

## Next Steps

1. Start Docker and Supabase local instance
2. Execute `supabase_fix_authority_name.sql` to fix authority name resolution
3. Test the complete flow from template creation to pass purchase
4. Verify all validation rules work correctly
