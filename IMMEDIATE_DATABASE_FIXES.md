# Immediate Database Fixes Required

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Row-Level Security Policy Violation ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Error:** `new row violates row-level security policy for table 'purchased_passes'`

**Impact:** Users cannot purchase passes - complete system failure

**Immediate Fix:**
```sql
\i fix_rls_policies.sql
```

**Root Cause:** RLS policies are too restrictive or incorrectly configured

### 2. Database Schema Mismatches
**Errors:**
- `column vehicle_types.name does not exist`
- `column vehicles.vin_number does not exist`

**Impact:** Vehicle type information not displayed, potential vehicle management issues

**Investigation Required:**
```sql
\i check_vehicle_schema.sql
```

## Immediate Action Plan

### Step 1: Fix Pass Purchase (CRITICAL)
```sql
-- Run this immediately to restore pass purchase functionality
\i fix_rls_policies.sql
```

### Step 2: Investigate Schema Issues
```sql
-- Run this to identify correct column names
\i check_vehicle_schema.sql
```

### Step 3: Update Application Code
Based on schema investigation results, update column names in:
- Vehicle service queries
- Pass template queries
- Any direct table references

## Temporary Workarounds Applied

### Code Changes Made:
1. **Enhanced error handling** for vehicle type fetching
2. **Multiple column name attempts** (name, type_name, label)
3. **Graceful degradation** when vehicle types can't be fetched
4. **Fallback display values** for missing data

### Current Status:
- ✅ Pass templates load with authority information
- ✅ Pedestrian passes supported
- ❌ Pass purchase blocked by RLS policy
- ⚠️ Vehicle types may not display correctly

## Database Schema Investigation Needed

### Questions to Answer:
1. What are the actual column names in `vehicle_types` table?
2. What are the actual column names in `vehicles` table?
3. What RLS policies exist on `purchased_passes`?
4. Are there any missing foreign key relationships?
5. Do RPC functions use correct column names?

### Expected Findings:
- `vehicle_types` might use `type_name` or `label` instead of `name`
- `vehicles` might use `vin` instead of `vin_number`
- RLS policies might be missing `auth.uid()` checks
- Some columns might be missing entirely

## Recovery Steps

### Immediate (Fix Pass Purchase):
1. Run `fix_rls_policies.sql` to disable/fix RLS
2. Test pass purchase functionality
3. Verify passes are created successfully

### Short-term (Fix Display Issues):
1. Run `check_vehicle_schema.sql` to identify schema
2. Update application code with correct column names
3. Test vehicle type display in purchase summary
4. Verify vehicle management functionality

### Long-term (Proper Security):
1. Implement proper RLS policies with correct user checks
2. Add database constraints and validations
3. Create comprehensive test suite for database operations
4. Document actual database schema

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk:
- Pass purchase completely broken
- Users cannot use core system functionality
- Potential data integrity issues

### Medium Risk:
- Vehicle information not displaying correctly
- User experience degraded
- Admin functions may be affected

### Low Risk:
- Cosmetic display issues
- Non-critical feature limitations

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success:
- [ ] Users can purchase passes without RLS errors
- [ ] Pass creation completes successfully
- [ ] Passes appear in user's pass list

### Complete Success:
- [ ] Vehicle types display correctly in purchase summary
- [ ] All database queries work without column errors
- [ ] Proper RLS policies protect user data
- [ ] System fully functional with all features working
