# Local Authority Movement History Improvements

## Changes Made

I've updated the local authority movement history display according to your requirements:

### ‚úÖ For Local Authority Scans

**Before:**
```
üõ°Ô∏è Routine Check by Local Authority
   by Officer Smith
   Oct 7, 2025 at 3:30 PM
   Notes: Vehicle inspection completed
```

**After:**
```
üõ°Ô∏è Routine Check
   Local Authority: Officer Smith
   Location: Mbabane, Hhohho, Eswatini
   Oct 7, 2025 at 3:30 PM
   Notes: Vehicle inspection completed
```

### ‚úÖ Specific Changes

#### 1. Removed "by Local Authority" from Title
- **Before**: "Routine Check by Local Authority"
- **After**: "Routine Check" (clean scan purpose only)

#### 2. Updated Official Display
- **Before**: "by Officer Smith"
- **After**: "Local Authority: Officer Smith" (shows it's local authority with officer name)

#### 3. Added Location Names
- **New**: Shows actual location names instead of coordinates
- Uses reverse geocoding to convert lat/lng to readable addresses
- Format: "Location: City, Region, Country"
- Falls back to coordinates if geocoding fails
- Cached to avoid repeated API calls

#### 4. Removed Entry Deduction Display
- **Before**: Showed "-1 entry" for all movements
- **After**: Only shows entry deduction for border control movements
- Local authority scans don't show entry deduction (since they don't deduct)

#### 5. Removed Status Changes
- Status change information is not displayed for local authority scans
- Keeps the display clean and focused on the scan purpose

### ‚úÖ For Border Control Movements (Unchanged)

Border control movements still show:
```
üîì Checked-In at Ngwenya Border
   by Bob Miller
   Location: Ngwenya, Hhohho, Eswatini
   Oct 7, 2025 at 5:00 PM
   -1 entry
```

### ‚úÖ Technical Implementation

#### Added Geocoding Package
- Uses `geocoding: ^3.0.0` (already in pubspec.yaml)
- Converts latitude/longitude to human-readable addresses

#### Location Caching
- Caches location lookups to avoid repeated API calls
- Uses rounded coordinates as cache keys
- Improves performance and reduces API usage

#### Smart Display Logic
- `_getMovementTitle()` - Returns clean scan purpose for local authority
- `_getOfficialName()` - Prefixes with "Local Authority:" for local authority scans
- `_getLocationName()` - Converts coordinates to location names
- Entry deduction only shown for border movements

### ‚úÖ Location Display Examples

The location display will show:
- **City level**: "Mbabane, Eswatini"
- **Regional**: "Mbabane, Hhohho, Eswatini"  
- **Detailed**: "Main Street, Mbabane, Hhohho, Eswatini"
- **Fallback**: "26.3054, 31.1367" (if geocoding fails)

### ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Cleaner Display**: Removed redundant "by Local Authority" text
2. **Better Context**: Shows actual location names instead of coordinates
3. **Proper Labeling**: Clear distinction between local authority and border officials
4. **Focused Information**: Only shows relevant data for each movement type
5. **Performance**: Cached location lookups for better performance

### ‚úÖ Files Updated

- **lib/screens/authority_validation_screen.dart**
  - Added geocoding import
  - Updated movement title formatting
  - Added location name lookup with caching
  - Updated official name display
  - Removed entry deduction for local authority scans

The movement history now provides a much cleaner and more informative display for local authority scans! üéâ
