# Manage Users Screen Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved: Database Schema Compatibility**

The "Access Error" in the Manage Users screen was caused by trying to query a `notes` column that doesn't exist in the `authority_profiles` table.

## 🔧 **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Updated AuthorityProfilesService**
- ✅ Removed `notes` field from the SELECT query in `getAuthorityProfiles()`
- ✅ Updated `updateAuthorityProfile()` to not attempt to update the non-existent `notes` column
- ✅ Added comments explaining the notes field limitation

### 2. **Updated AuthorityProfile Model**
- ✅ Set `notes` field to always return `null` since it doesn't exist in the database
- ✅ Maintained model compatibility for future schema updates

### 3. **Updated Manage Users Screen**
- ✅ Removed notes input field from the edit dialog
- ✅ Removed notes display section from user cards
- ✅ Added comments explaining why notes functionality is disabled
- ✅ Maintained all other functionality (display name, active status)

## 📊 **Current Functionality**

### ✅ **Working Features**
- View all users in an authority
- Edit user display names
- Activate/deactivate users
- View user profile images
- View user email addresses
- View when users were assigned to the authority
- Proper error handling and loading states

### ❌ **Disabled Features**
- Administrative notes (database column doesn't exist)

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The original error occurred because the code was trying to:
1. SELECT a `notes` column that doesn't exist in `authority_profiles` table
2. UPDATE a `notes` column that doesn't exist

This caused a PostgreSQL error which was displayed as "Access Error" in the UI.

## ✅ **Solution**

1. **Removed database queries for non-existent columns**
2. **Maintained UI compatibility** by gracefully handling missing fields
3. **Preserved all working functionality** while disabling only the problematic notes feature

## 🚀 **Result**

The Manage Users screen should now:
- ✅ Load without errors
- ✅ Display all users properly
- ✅ Allow editing of user status and display names
- ✅ Work with the current database schema
- ✅ Be ready for future schema updates (notes can be re-enabled when column is added)

## 📋 **Files Modified**

- `lib/services/authority_profiles_service.dart` - Removed notes field queries
- `lib/models/authority_profile.dart` - Set notes to null
- `lib/screens/manage_users_screen.dart` - Removed notes UI components

The screen should now work perfectly with the existing database schema!
