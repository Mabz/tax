# Non-Compliance Analytics Enhancement Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the BI Pass Analytics Non-Compliance section to use authority-specific currency and added time period filtering capabilities.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Business Intelligence Service Updates (`lib/services/business_intelligence_service.dart`)

#### Authority Currency Integration
- Modified `getPassAnalyticsData()` to fetch the authority's `default_currency_code`
- Added `authorityCurrency` field to the returned analytics data
- Revenue at Risk now uses the authority's currency instead of individual pass currencies

#### New Non-Compliance Analytics Method
- Added `getNonComplianceAnalytics()` method with enhanced filtering:
  - Time period filtering (all_time, current_month, last_month, etc.)
  - Border filtering
  - Detailed overdue analysis (1-7 days, 8-30 days, 31-90 days, 90+ days)
  - Authority currency for revenue calculations

### 2. Pass Analytics Screen Updates (`lib/screens/bi/pass_analytics_screen.dart`)

#### Non-Compliance Tab Enhancements
- Added time period and border filters to the Non-Compliance tab
- Updated Revenue at Risk display to use authority currency
- Added detailed non-compliant passes list with:
  - Vehicle information
  - Days overdue with severity indicators
  - Revenue at risk per pass
  - Border information

#### New UI Components
- `_buildNonComplianceFilters()`: Time period and border selection filters
- `_buildNonCompliantPassesList()`: Detailed list of violations
- `_buildNonCompliantPassItem()`: Individual pass violation display

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Authority Currency Usage
- Revenue at Risk now displays in the authority's default currency
- Format: `USD 1,234.56` instead of generic `$1,234.56`
- Consistent currency display across all non-compliance metrics

### ✅ Time Period Filtering
- Same time period options as Overview section:
  - All Time
  - Current Month
  - Last Month
  - Last 3 Months
  - Last 6 Months
  - Custom Date Range
- Filters apply to both expired passes and overstayed vehicles

### ✅ Enhanced Non-Compliance Details
- Detailed list of all non-compliant passes
- Severity indicators based on days overdue:
  - **Recent** (1-7 days): Orange
  - **Critical** (8-30 days): Red
  - **Severe** (90+ days): Purple
- Individual revenue at risk per violation

### ✅ Improved User Experience
- Filter controls similar to Overview tab for consistency
- Clear indication of selected time period in Revenue at Risk description
- Empty state when no violations are found
- Sortable list (most overdue first)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
1. User selects time period and/or border filter
2. `getPassAnalyticsData()` fetches authority currency and filtered pass data
3. Non-compliance calculations use authority currency for consistency
4. UI displays filtered results with proper currency formatting

### Currency Handling
```dart
// Authority currency fetched from database
final authorityCurrency = authorityResponse['default_currency_code'] as String? ?? 'USD';

// Revenue at Risk calculation uses authority currency
final revenueAtRisk = expiredButActive.fold<double>(0.0, (sum, p) => sum + p.amount);

// Display format
'$authorityCurrency ${revenueAtRisk.toStringAsFixed(2)}'
```

### Time Period Filtering
- Reuses existing `_filterPassesByPeriod()` method
- Consistent filtering logic across all analytics tabs
- Supports custom date ranges

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to BI → Pass Analytics
2. Select the "Non-Compliance" tab
3. Use the time period filter to focus on specific periods
4. Use the border filter to analyze specific entry points
5. Review detailed violation list for enforcement actions

### For Developers
- The enhanced analytics data is available through existing `getPassAnalyticsData()` method
- New `getNonComplianceAnalytics()` method provides additional detailed analysis
- All currency formatting uses authority-specific currency codes
- Time period filtering is consistent across all analytics features

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time alerts for new violations
- Export functionality for enforcement reports
- Integration with enforcement action tracking
- Automated penalty calculation based on days overdue
- Email notifications for critical violations
