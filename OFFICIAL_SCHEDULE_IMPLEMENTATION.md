- **Icons & Accents**: Consistent red theming throughout
- **Visual Identity**: Matches the "Validate Passes" screen styling

#### **2. Same Access Credentials** 🔐
- **Location**: Border Control section in navigation drawer
- **Access**: Same as "Validate Passes" - requires `_isBorderOfficialForSelected()`
- **Authentication**: Uses current user's Supabase session

#### **3. Two-Tab Interface** 📋

##### **Tab 1: Current Schedule**
- **Official Profile**: Name, role, and active status
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time performance data for current month
  - Total scans processed
  - Efficiency (scans per hour)
  - Scheduled hours
  - Average processing time
- **Current Assignments**: All active schedule assignments

##### **Tab 2: Schedule History**
- **Historical Assignments**: Past 20 schedule assignments
- **Timeline View**: Shows effective dates for each assignment
- **Assignment Details**: Border, template, time slots, and assignment type

#### **4. Performance Analytics** 📊
- **Real-Time Metrics**: Based on actual scan data from `pass_movements`
- **Scheduled Hours**: Calculated from current time slot assignments
- **Efficiency Calculation**: Scans per scheduled hour
- **Processing Time**: Average time to process each scan

#### **5. Assignment Details** 📅
- **Color-Coded Types**:
  - 🌟 **Green** (Primary assignments)
  - 🔄 **Orange** (Backup assignments)  
  - ⏰ **Blue** (Temporary assignments)
- **Complete Information**: Border name, template name, day/time, duration
- **Date Ranges**: Shows when assignments were active

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Data Sources:**
```sql

official_schedule_assignments WHERE effective_to IS NULL

-- Historical assignments (completed)
official_schedule_assignments WHERE effective_to IS NOT NULL

-- Performance data
pass_movements WHERE profile_id = current_user_id
```

### **Key Queries:**
- **Current Schedule**: Joins assignments → time_slots → templates → borders
