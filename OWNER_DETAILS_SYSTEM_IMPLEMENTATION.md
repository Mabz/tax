# Owner Details System Implementation

## Overview
Created a comprehensive owner details system that allows authorities (Local Authority and Border Officials) to view complete owner information through a popup interface. This can be used across multiple screens including Overstayed Vehicles, Vehicle Details, and other authority interfaces.

## Components Created

### 1. **OwnerDetailsPopup Widget** (`lib/widgets/owner_details_popup.dart`)
A comprehensive popup dialog that displays complete owner information including:

#### **Profile Section**
- Profile image (with fallback to default icon)
- Full name and email
- "Vehicle Owner" badge
- Professional layout with blue theme

#### **Personal Information**
- Full name, email, phone number, address
- Organized in clean info rows
- Handles missing data gracefully

#### **Identity Documents**
- Country of origin with name and code
- National ID number
- Passport number
- Fetched securely through authority functions

#### **Contact Information**
- Primary email and phone number
- Residential address
- Duplicate-free display of contact methods

#### **Passport Page**
- Full passport page image display
- "View Full Size" button for detailed inspection
- Interactive viewer with zoom capabilities
- Error handling for failed image loads

#### **Additional Information**
- Profile creation and update timestamps
- Profile ID for reference
- Formatted date display

### 2. **OwnerDetailsButton Widget** (`lib/widgets/owner_details_button.dart`)
Flexible button component with multiple variants:

#### **Standard Button**
```dart
OwnerDetailsButton(
  ownerId: 'profile-uuid',
  ownerName: 'John Doe',
  buttonText: 'View Owner',
)
```

#### **Icon Button**
```dart
OwnerDetailsButton(
  ownerId: 'profile-uuid',
  isIconButton: true,
)
```

#### **Compact Button**
```dart
CompactOwnerDetailsButton(
  ownerId: 'profile-uuid',
  ownerName: 'John Doe',
)
```

### 3. **Database Security Functions** (`create_owner_details_access.sql`)

#### **Authority Access Control**
- `get_owner_profile_for_authority()` - Secure profile access
- `get_owner_identity_for_authority()` - Identity document access
- `get_pass_owner_details()` - Pass-to-owner mapping

#### **Security Features**
- Authority verification before data access
- RLS-compliant data retrieval
- Proper error handling for unauthorized access

### 4. **Service Layer Updates** (`lib/services/profile_management_service.dart`)
- `getProfileById()` - Secure profile retrieval
- `getPassOwnerDetails()` - Pass owner information
- Integration with existing identity document functions

## Usage Examples

### **In Overstayed Vehicles Screen**
```dart
// Add to vehicle list items
OwnerDetailsButton(
  ownerId: vehicle['owner_id'],
  ownerName: vehicle['owner_name'],
  buttonText: 'Owner Info',
)
```

### **In Vehicle Details Screen**
```dart
// Add to vehicle information section
Row(
  children: [
    Text('Owner: ${ownerName}'),
    SizedBox(width: 8),
    CompactOwnerDetailsButton(
      ownerId: ownerId,
      ownerName: ownerName,
    ),
  ],
)
```

### **In Pass Verification**
```dart
// Add to pass details
OwnerDetailsButton(
  ownerId: passOwnerId,
  isIconButton: true,
)
```
