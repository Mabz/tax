# Passport Upload Issues - Complete Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Row Security Policy Violation
**Problem**: Users couldn't upload passport photos due to storage RLS policy violations.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive storage policies in `fix_passport_upload_issues.sql`:
- ✅ Fixed bucket policies for user file uploads
- ✅ Added proper RLS policies for INSERT, SELECT, DELETE operations
- ✅ Ensured users can only access their own files
- ✅ Added public read access for file viewing

### 2. Duplicate Function Error
**Problem**: Multiple `update_identity_documents` functions causing conflicts.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Dropped all existing versions of the function
- ✅ Created single, clean version with proper audit logging
- ✅ Fixed UUID conversion issues
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility

### 3. Passport Cropping with Standard Dimensions
**Problem**: Need to crop passport photos to standard 4.9" × 3.4" dimensions.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive cropping system:
- ✅ `PassportCropWidget` with proper aspect ratio (4.9:3.4 ≈ 1.44:1)
- ✅ Pan and zoom functionality for precise positioning
- ✅ Visual crop overlay with passport dimensions
- ✅ Corner indicators and dimension labels
- ✅ Control buttons for zoom and reset
