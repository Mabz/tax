# Pass ID Display Addition to Audit Trail

## Enhancement Overview
Added Pass ID display to the audit trail to help border officials quickly identify which pass was used for each activity, improving traceability and investigation capabilities.

## Implementation Details

### Display Logic
```dart
if (movement.passId != null && movement.passId!.isNotEmpty) ...[
  const SizedBox(height: 4),
  Row(
    children: [
      Icon(Icons.confirmation_number, size: 12, color: Colors.grey.shade600),
      const SizedBox(width: 4),
      Expanded(
        child: Text(
          'Pass: ${_formatPassId(movement.passId!)}',
          style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: 12,
            color: Colors.grey.shade600,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.w500,
          ),
          maxLines: 1,
          overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
],
```

### Pass ID Formatting
```dart
String _formatPassId(String passId) {
  // Show first 8 characters of the pass ID for brevity
  if (passId.length > 8) {
    return '${passId.substring(0, 8)}...';
  }
  return passId;
}
```
