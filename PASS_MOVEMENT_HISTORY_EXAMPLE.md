## Key Improvements

### 1. **Entry Deduction Tracking**
- Always shows "Entries Deducted: X" format
- Green badge when 0 entries deducted (no impact)
- Red badge when entries were deducted (shows impact)
- Helps track pass usage patterns

### 2. **Local Authority Scan Purpose**
- `routine_check` → **"Routine Check"**
- `security_inspection` → **"Security Inspection"**  
- `document_verification` → **"Document Verification"**
- `random_check` → **"Random Check"**

### 3. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Current movement highlighted with blue "Current" badge
- Entry deductions shown with red badges instead of "active" status
- Proper activity names instead of generic "Border Activity"
- "Unknown Border" displays as "Local Authority" for local authority scans
- Notes displayed inline next to time for better space usage
- Vehicle details shown with car icon (registration, make, model)
- Pass ID displayed with ticket icon (first 8 characters for brevity)
