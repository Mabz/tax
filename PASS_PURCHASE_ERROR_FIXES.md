# Pass Purchase Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Error: Missing Columns
**Error:** `Could not find the 'authority_name' column of 'purchased_passes' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause:** The pass creation code was trying to insert data into denormalized columns (`authority_name`, `country_name`, `entry_point_name`, `exit_point_name`) that don't exist in the database schema.

**Solution:**
- Created `fix_purchased_passes_schema.sql` to add the missing columns
- Added error handling in pass creation to fall back to basic insert if columns don't exist
- The app now works whether the denormalized columns exist or not

### 2. Realtime Client Type Casting Error
**Error:** `TypeError: Instance of 'JSArray<dynamic>': type 'List<dynamic>' is not a subtype of type 'List<Binding>'`

**Root Cause:** Known issue with the Supabase realtime client type casting.

**Solution:**
- Temporarily disabled realtime subscriptions to prevent crashes
- Added proper error handling in dispose method
- App continues to work without realtime updates
- Users can manually refresh using pull-to-refresh

## Files Modified

### lib/services/pass_service.dart
- Added error handling for missing denormalized columns
- Pass creation now falls back to basic insert if advanced columns don't exist
- Maintains backward compatibility

### lib/screens/pass_dashboard_screen.dart
- Disabled problematic realtime subscriptions
- Added proper error handling in dispose method
- Enhanced purchase dialog result handling

## Database Migration

### SQL Script: fix_purchased_passes_schema.sql
- Safely adds missing denormalized columns if they don't exist
- Updates existing passes with denormalized data
- Includes verification queries

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run the database migration:**
   ```sql
   \i fix_purchased_passes_schema.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy the code changes**

3. **Test pass purchase functionality**

4. **Optional: Re-enable realtime subscriptions when Supabase client is updated**

## Benefits

- **Immediate Fix:** Pass purchase now works without database errors
- **Backward Compatible:** Works with or without denormalized columns
- **Performance:** Denormalized columns improve query performance when available
- **Stability:** Removed crash-prone realtime subscriptions
- **User Experience:** Manual refresh still available via pull-to-refresh

## Future Improvements

1. **Re-enable realtime subscriptions** when Supabase client type casting issue is resolved
2. **Add automatic refresh** after pass purchase
3. **Consider using database triggers** to maintain denormalized data consistency
4. **Add database constraints** to ensure data integrity
