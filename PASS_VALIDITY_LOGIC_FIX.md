# Pass Validity Logic Fix

## Problem
Local Authority scans were incorrectly showing "Pass Invalid" for vehicles that:
- Had 0 entries remaining 
- But were already checked into the country
- And had not yet expired

This was incorrect because vehicles should be considered legal as long as they haven't expired, regardless of remaining entries if they're already in the country.

## Root Cause
The `isActive` getter in `PurchasedPass` model was using incorrect logic:

```dart
// BEFORE (incorrect)
bool get isActive =>
    status == 'active' && !isExpired && isActivated && hasEntriesRemaining;
```

This meant any pass with 0 entries was considered inactive, even if the vehicle was legally in the country.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Pass Activity Logic
**File**: `lib/models/purchased_pass.dart`

```dart
// AFTER (correct)
bool get isActive =>
    status == 'active' && !isExpired && isActivated && 
    (hasEntriesRemaining || currentStatus == 'checked_in');
```

**Logic**: A pass is active if it's not expired AND either:
- Has entries remaining, OR  
- Vehicle is currently checked into the country

### 2. Enhanced Validation Messages
**File**: `lib/screens/authority_validation_screen.dart`

**For Consumed Passes**:
- **If vehicle is checked_in**: Shows "Vehicle is LEGAL" with expiry date
- **If vehicle is checked_out**: Shows "Pass CONSUMED" (needs new pass for future travel)

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
- Vehicle with 0 entries + checked_in status → "Pass Invalid"
- Incorrect message: "Vehicle is not authorized to be in the country"

### After Fix  
- Vehicle with 0 entries + checked_in status → "Vehicle is LEGAL"
- Correct message: "Pass entries consumed but vehicle is legally in country until [expiry date]"

## Business Logic
This fix aligns with proper border control logic:
1. **Entries control border crossings** (entry/exit events)
2. **Expiry date controls legal presence** (how long can stay)
3. **Vehicle can stay until expiry** even with 0 entries remaining
4. **New entries only needed for future travel** (re-entry after exit)

## Files Modified
1. `lib/models/purchased_pass.dart` - Fixed isActive logic
2. `lib/screens/authority_validation_screen.dart` - Enhanced validation messages

## Testing
Test with a pass that has:
- Status: active
- Entries remaining: 0  
- Current status: checked_in
- Expiry date: future date

Should now show "Vehicle is LEGAL" instead of "Pass Invalid".
