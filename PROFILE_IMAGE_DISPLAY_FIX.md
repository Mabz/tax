# Profile Image Display Fix for Movement History

## Problem Identified
Profile images were not displaying in the Pass Movement History screen even though the URLs were accessible. The issue was in the SQL function `get_pass_movement_history`.

## Root Cause
The SQL function was incorrectly joining with the profiles table using `auth.uid()` (current user) instead of `pm.processed_by` (the official who processed the movement). This meant:
- All movements showed the current user's profile image (or no image)
- The actual official's profile image was never retrieved

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed SQL Function
**File**: `consistent_profile_data_function.sql`

**Key Changes**:
```sql
-- BEFORE (incorrect)
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.id = auth.uid()

-- AFTER (correct)  
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.id = pm.processed_by
```

**Additional Fields Added**:
- `notes` - For local authority scan notes
- `scan_purpose` - For local authority scan purpose
- `authority_type` - To distinguish authority types

### 2. Model Already Correct
The `PassMovement` model in `enhanced_border_service.dart` already had:
- `officialProfileImageUrl` field
- Proper JSON parsing for the field
- All additional fields needed

### 3. Widget Already Correct
The `ProfileImageWidget` in `pass_history_widget.dart` was already:
- Correctly receiving the `officialProfileImageUrl`
- Properly handling non-editable display mode
- Including error handling for failed image loads

## Files Modified
1. `consistent_profile_data_function.sql` - Fixed profile join logic
2. `test_profile_image_fix.sql` - Created test queries

## Testing Steps
1. Apply the SQL function: `consistent_profile_data_function.sql`
2. Test with: `test_profile_image_fix.sql`
3. Verify profile images now display for each official in movement history

## Expected Result
- Each movement entry shows the profile image of the official who processed it
- Different officials will have different profile images
- Fallback to default person icon if no profile image exists
- No changes needed to Flutter code - the issue was purely in the database function
