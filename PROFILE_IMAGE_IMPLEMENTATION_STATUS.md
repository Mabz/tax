- ✅ iOS permissions added to Info.plist
- ✅ User-specific folder structure (`{user_id}/profile_image_*`)

### 🚀 **Error Handling & UX**
- ✅ Robust error handling for image picker issues
- ✅ Loading states during upload/delete
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Fallback for unavailable image picker
- ✅ Proper async handling with mounted checks

### 📱 **Platform Support**
- ✅ Android: Full support with permissions
- ✅ iOS: Full support with permissions  
- ✅ Web: Byte-based upload support
- ✅ Cross-platform image picker service

## **Files Created/Modified**

### **New Files**
- `lib/services/storage_service.dart` - Handles Supabase storage operations
- `lib/services/image_picker_service.dart` - Robust image picker with error handling
- `lib/widgets/profile_image_widget.dart` - Reusable profile image component
- `setup_profile_image_storage.sql` - Database setup script
- `IMAGE_PICKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Troubleshooting guide
- `PROFILE_IMAGE_UPLOAD_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation documentation

### **Modified Files**
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added image_picker and path dependencies
- `lib/services/profile_management_service.dart` - Added image URL methods
- `lib/screens/profile_settings_screen.dart` - Integrated profile image widget
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added permissions
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Added permissions

## **Database Setup Required**

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: You must run the SQL setup before testing image uploads.

Execute one of these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor:

**Option 1: Simple Setup (Recommended)**
```sql
-- Run the contents of simple_storage_setup.sql
```

**Option 2: Advanced Setup**
```sql
-- Run the contents of fix_storage_rls_policies.sql
```

**If you get RLS policy errors**, see `STORAGE_RLS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed solutions.

## **Testing Checklist**

- ✅ Code compiles without errors
- ✅ No diagnostic issues
- ✅ Platform permissions configured
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

## **Usage**

1. **For Users:**
   - Navigate to Profile Settings
   - Tap the profile image area
   - Select "Upload New Image" or "Remove Image"

2. **For Developers:**
   ```dart
   ProfileImageWidget(
     currentImageUrl: user.profileImageUrl,
     size: 80,
     isEditable: true,
     onImageUpdated: () => refreshProfile(),
   )
   ```

## **Next Steps**

1. **Execute SQL setup** in Supabase
2. **Test on device** - upload/remove images
3. **Deploy and monitor** for any issues

## **Support**

If you encounter the "unable to establish connection on channel imagepickerapi" error:
- Check `IMAGE_PICKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- Verify platform permissions are granted
- Try on a different device/emulator
