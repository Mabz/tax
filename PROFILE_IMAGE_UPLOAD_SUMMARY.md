# Profile Image Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented profile image upload functionality for the BorderTax Flutter application with Supabase storage integration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Storage Service (`lib/services/storage_service.dart`)
- **Upload functionality**: Supports both File (mobile) and Uint8List (web) uploads
- **User-specific folders**: Images are stored with user ID prefix (`{user_id}/profile_image_{timestamp}.ext`)
- **Security**: Users can only access their own images
- **File management**: Upload, delete, and list user's profile images
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages

### 2. Profile Image Widget (`lib/widgets/profile_image_widget.dart`)
- **Reusable component**: Can be used throughout the app
- **Interactive**: Tap to show options (upload/remove)
- **Loading states**: Shows progress during upload/delete operations
- **Fallback display**: Shows default person icon when no image is available
- **Edit indicator**: Visual cue showing the image is editable
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both mobile and web

### 3. Profile Management Service Updates
- **Database integration**: Added `profile_image_url` field support
- **CRUD operations**: Update and remove profile image URLs
- **Profile data**: Includes image URL in profile queries

### 4. Profile Settings Screen Integration
- **Seamless integration**: Replaced static CircleAvatar with ProfileImageWidget
- **Auto-refresh**: Profile data refreshes when image is updated
- **User experience**: Smooth integration with existing profile settings

### 5. Database Setup (`setup_profile_image_storage.sql`)
- **Storage bucket**: Creates 'BorderTax' bucket with public access
- **Security policies**: 
  - Users can upload/update/delete their own images
  - All users can view profile images (read access)
  - Folder-based security using user ID prefixes
- **Database schema**: Adds `profile_image_url` column to profiles table

## Security Implementation

### Storage Policies
1. **Upload Policy**: Users can only upload to their own folder (`{user_id}/profile_image_*`)
2. **Read Policy**: Anyone can view profile images (for public profiles)
3. **Update Policy**: Users can only update their own images
4. **Delete Policy**: Users can only delete their own images

### File Organization
- Files are organized by user ID: `{user_id}/profile_image_{timestamp}.ext`
- Prevents unauthorized access to other users' files
- Easy cleanup and management per user

## Dependencies Added
```yaml
dependencies:
  image_picker: ^1.0.4  # For selecting images from gallery/camera
  path: ^1.8.3          # For file path operations
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Navigate to Profile Settings
2. Tap on the profile image area
3. Select "Choose from Gallery" to upload a new image
4. Select "Remove Image" to delete current image
5. Image automatically saves and updates across the app

### For Developers
```dart
// Use the ProfileImageWidget anywhere in the app
ProfileImageWidget(
  currentImageUrl: user.profileImageUrl,
  size: 80,
  isEditable: true,
  onImageUpdated: () {
    // Handle image update
  },
)
```

## Database Setup Required
Run the SQL script to set up storage bucket and policies:
```bash
# Execute the setup script in your Supabase SQL editor
cat setup_profile_image_storage.sql
```

## File Structure
```
lib/
├── services/
│   ├── storage_service.dart          # New: Handles file uploads/downloads
│   └── profile_management_service.dart # Updated: Added image URL methods
├── widgets/
│   └── profile_image_widget.dart     # New: Reusable profile image component

## Next Steps
1. **Execute SQL setup**: Run `setup_profile_image_storage.sql` in Supabase
2. **Test functionality**: Upload, view, and delete profile images
3. **If image picker issues occur**: See `IMAGE_PICKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
4. **Optional enhancements**:
   - Image compression/resizing
   - Multiple image formats support
   - Crop functionality
   - Image validation (size, format)
