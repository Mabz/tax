# Purchase Summary Redesign

## Overview
Redesigned the Purchase Summary section to clearly separate pass details from vehicle details in a two-column layout for better organization and user understanding.

## Problems Solved

### 1. Confusing Single-Column Layout
**Before:** All information mixed together in one column
- Country, Authority, Entry/Exit points
- Vehicle Type, Vehicle selection
- Entries, dates, etc.
- No clear separation between pass and vehicle info

**After:** Clear two-column separation
- **Left Column:** Pass Details (what you're buying)
- **Right Column:** Vehicle Details (what it's for)

### 2. Unclear "Vehicle" Label
**Before:** Generic "Vehicle" label showing selected vehicle name
**After:** Detailed vehicle information with specific properties

### 3. Poor Visual Hierarchy
**Before:** All information looked the same
**After:** Color-coded sections with appropriate icons

## New Design Structure

### Left Column - Pass Details (Blue Theme)
- **Icon:** Receipt icon
- **Color:** Blue background with blue border
- **Information:**
  - Country
  - Authority
  - Entry Point
  - Exit Point
  - Vehicle Type (from template)
  - Entries allowed
  - Valid for (days)
  - Activation Date
  - Expiration Date

### Right Column - Vehicle Details (Orange/Green Theme)
- **Icon:** Car icon (or walking icon for pedestrian)
- **Color:** Orange for vehicles, Green for pedestrian passes
- **Information:**
  - Make & Model
  - Year
  - Color
  - Number Plate (if available)
  - VIN (if available)
  - Special pedestrian pass indicator

## Visual Improvements

### Color Coding
- **Pass Details:** Blue theme (official/document feel)
- **Vehicle Details:** Orange theme (vehicle-related)
- **Pedestrian Pass:** Green theme (eco-friendly/walking)

### Icons
- **Pass Details:** Receipt/document icon
- **Vehicle Details:** Car icon
- **Pedestrian Pass:** Walking person icon

### Layout
- **Responsive:** Two equal columns on larger screens
- **Compact:** Smaller text and spacing for mobile
- **Clear Separation:** Visual borders and backgrounds

## Technical Implementation

### New Components
- `_buildCompactSummaryRow()` - Compact row format for two-column layout
- Enhanced conditional logic for vehicle vs pedestrian passes
- Color-coded containers based on selection type

### Data Display
- **Vehicle Properties:** Make, model, year, color, registration, VIN
- **Fallback Handling:** Graceful display when vehicle data is missing
- **Pedestrian Indicator:** Special styling for non-vehicle passes

### Responsive Design
- Equal column widths (Expanded flex: 1)
- Proper spacing and padding
- Overflow handling for long text

## User Experience Benefits

### Clarity
- **Clear Separation:** Users can easily distinguish pass info from vehicle info
- **Logical Grouping:** Related information grouped together
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Important information stands out

### Completeness
- **Full Vehicle Details:** All relevant vehicle information displayed
- **Pass Information:** Complete pass details in one place
- **Status Indicators:** Clear visual cues for different pass types

### Professional Appearance
- **Clean Layout:** Well-organized, professional look
- **Color Coordination:** Consistent color scheme
- **Proper Spacing:** Good use of whitespace

## Mobile Considerations

### Compact Design
- Smaller font sizes (11px) for mobile screens
- Efficient use of space
- Proper text overflow handling

### Touch-Friendly
- Adequate spacing between elements
- Clear visual boundaries
- Easy to scan information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Vehicle Photo:** Small thumbnail if available
- **Pass Preview:** Mini pass design preview
- **Cost Breakdown:** Detailed pricing information
- **Terms & Conditions:** Quick access to relevant terms

### Interactive Elements
- **Edit Links:** Quick edit buttons for each section
- **Validation Indicators:** Green checkmarks for complete sections
- **Help Icons:** Tooltips for complex information
