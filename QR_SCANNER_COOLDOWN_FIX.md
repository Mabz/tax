# QR Scanner Cooldown Implementation

## Problem Solved

The QR scanner was being too eager and immediately rescanning after errors, creating a poor user experience where:
- Failed scans would immediately trigger another scan attempt
- Users couldn't read error messages before the scanner tried again
- Successful scans would continue scanning unnecessarily

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cooldown Management
Added a 3-second cooldown period between scan attempts:

```dart
// QR Scanner cooldown management
DateTime? _lastScanAttempt;
bool _scanningEnabled = true;
static const Duration _scanCooldownDuration = Duration(seconds: 3);
Timer? _cooldownTimer;
```

### 2. Scan Control Logic
Implemented `_canProcessScan()` method that prevents scanning when:
- Already processing a scan
- Scanning is disabled (after successful scan)
- Within cooldown period after failed scan

```dart
bool _canProcessScan() {
  if (_isProcessing) return false;
  if (!_scanningEnabled) return false;
  
  if (_lastScanAttempt != null) {
    final timeSinceLastScan = DateTime.now().difference(_lastScanAttempt!);
    if (timeSinceLastScan < _scanCooldownDuration) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

### 3. Visual Feedback
Added dynamic status text that shows:
- "Processing QR code..." during validation
- "Please wait Xs before scanning again" during cooldown
- "Scanning disabled - use 'Scan Another Pass' to continue" after success
- "Position QR code within the frame" when ready

### 4. Real-time Updates
Implemented a timer that updates the UI every second during cooldown:

```dart
void _startCooldownTimer() {
  _cooldownTimer?.cancel();
  _cooldownTimer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (timer) {
    // Update countdown display and clear timer when done
  });
}
```

### 5. Behavior Changes

#### On Successful Scan:
- Scanner stops immediately
- Scanning is disabled until user explicitly chooses "Scan Another Pass"
- Prevents accidental double-scanning

#### On Failed Scan:
- 3-second cooldown period begins
- Visual countdown shows remaining time
- Scanner automatically re-enables after cooldown
- Allows retry without manual intervention

#### On Reset:
- All cooldown timers are cleared
- Scanning is re-enabled
- Fresh scanner controller is created

## Files Modified

### `lib/screens/authority_validation_screen.dart`
- Added cooldown state variables
- Implemented `_canProcessScan()` logic
- Added `_getScanningStatusText()` for dynamic feedback
- Added `_startCooldownTimer()` for real-time updates
- Updated `_validateQRCode()` to use cooldown
- Updated `_resetScanning()` to clear cooldown state
- Updated `dispose()` to clean up timer

### `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart`
- Fixed deprecated `withOpacity()` usage to `withValues(alpha: 0.1)`

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Scanner would immediately retry after errors
- No feedback about why scanning wasn't working
- Successful scans could be accidentally repeated
- Error messages were hard to read due to immediate rescanning

### After:
- Clear 3-second pause after failed scans
- Visual countdown showing when scanning will resume
- Scanning stops after successful validation
- User must explicitly choose to scan again after success
- Better error message visibility

## Technical Benefits

1. **Prevents Spam Scanning**: Cooldown prevents rapid-fire scan attempts
2. **Better Error Handling**: Users can read error messages without interference
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary processing and network calls
4. **Improved UX**: Clear feedback about scanner state and timing
5. **Proper Cleanup**: Timer disposal prevents memory leaks

## Usage

The cooldown system works automatically:

1. **Normal Operation**: Scanner works normally when ready
2. **After Error**: 3-second cooldown with countdown display
3. **After Success**: Scanner disabled until manual reset
4. **Manual Reset**: "Scan Another Pass" button re-enables scanning

No additional configuration or user action required - the system handles all timing and state management automatically.

## Testing

To test the cooldown system:

1. **Test Failed Scan**: Scan invalid QR code, observe 3-second countdown
2. **Test Successful Scan**: Scan valid pass, verify scanner stops
3. **Test Reset**: Use "Scan Another Pass" button, verify scanner restarts
4. **Test Multiple Failures**: Try multiple invalid scans, verify cooldown applies each time

The system provides a much more controlled and user-friendly scanning experience.
