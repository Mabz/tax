# Type Cast Error Fix for Border Processing

## Problem
When checking in/out, the app was failing with the error:
```
Error details: type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'String' in type cast
```

This was happening because the database functions were returning null values, but the Dart code was trying to cast them as non-nullable Strings.

## Root Causes
1. **Unsafe String casting** - Using `as String` instead of `as String?` with fallbacks
2. **Unsafe DateTime parsing** - Not checking for null before parsing dates
3. **Database function changes** - Recent SQL function updates may have changed return types

## Fixes Applied

### 1. PassMovementResult.fromJson - Made all casts safe
**Before:**
```dart
movementId: json['movement_id'] as String,
movementType: json['movement_type'] as String,
previousStatus: json['previous_status'] as String,
newStatus: json['new_status'] as String,
processedAt: DateTime.parse(json['processed_at'] as String),
```

**After:**
```dart
movementId: json['movement_id'] as String? ?? '',
movementType: json['movement_type'] as String? ?? 'unknown',
previousStatus: json['previous_status'] as String? ?? '',
newStatus: json['new_status'] as String? ?? '',
processedAt: json['processed_at'] != null 
    ? DateTime.parse(json['processed_at'] as String)
    : DateTime.now(),
```

### 2. PassMovement.fromJson - Safe DateTime parsing
**Before:**
```dart
processedAt: DateTime.parse(json['processed_at'] as String),
```

**After:**
```dart
processedAt: json['processed_at'] != null 
    ? DateTime.parse(json['processed_at'] as String)
    : DateTime.now(),
```

### 3. PassMovement.fromAuditJson - Safe DateTime parsing
**Before:**
```dart
processedAt: DateTime.parse(json['performed_at'] as String),
```

**After:**
```dart
processedAt: json['performed_at'] != null 
    ? DateTime.parse(json['performed_at'] as String)
    : DateTime.now(),
```

### 4. Pass Status Check - Safe DateTime and expiry parsing
**Before:**
```dart
final expiresAt = DateTime.parse(response['expires_at'] as String);
```

**After:**
```dart
final expiresAt = response['expires_at'] != null 
    ? DateTime.parse(response['expires_at'] as String)
    : DateTime.now().add(const Duration(days: 30));
```

### 5. Movement History - Safe DateTime parsing
**Before:**
```dart
processedAt: DateTime.parse(movementData['processed_at'] as String),
```

**After:**
```dart
processedAt: movementData['processed_at'] != null 
    ? DateTime.parse(movementData['processed_at'] as String)
    : DateTime.now(),
```

## Files Modified
- `lib/services/enhanced_border_service.dart` - Added null safety to all type casts

## Expected Result
- Check-in/check-out should now work without type cast errors
- Profile images should display correctly in movement history
- App should handle null database values gracefully
- Better error resilience overall

## Testing
1. Try checking in/out again - should work without errors
2. Check movement history - profile images should now display
3. Verify all functionality works as expected
