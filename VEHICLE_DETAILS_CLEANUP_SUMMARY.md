# Vehicle Details Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Timeline/Movement History Section**
- **Removed**: `_buildTimelineSection(vehicle)` call from vehicle details modal
- **Benefit**: Cleaner, more focused vehicle details interface
- **Result**: Vehicle details now shows only essential information without timeline clutter

### 2. **Fixed "Owner details not available" Issue**
- **Problem**: `profileId` was missing from the overstayed vehicles data structure
- **Root Cause**: `BusinessIntelligenceService.getOverstayedVehiclesDetails()` was fetching profile data but not including the profile ID in the returned data
- **Solution**: Added `'profileId': profile?['id']?.toString()` to the data structure

## Updated Vehicle Details Layout

### **Before**
```
┌─ Vehicle Details ──────────────────────┐
│ Vehicle Information                     │
│ Owner Information                       │
│ Pass Information                        │
│ Timeline Section ←── REMOVED            │
│ Action Buttons                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **After**
```
┌─ Vehicle Details ──────────────────────┐
│ Vehicle Information                     │
│ Owner Information                       │
│ ✅ [View Complete Owner Details] ←── NOW WORKS │
│ Pass Information                        │
│ [View Pass History]                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Data Structure Fix

### **Before (Missing profileId)**
```dart
detailedList.add({
  'passId': pass.passId,
  'vehicleDescription': pass.vehicleDescription,
  // ... other fields
  'ownerFullName': ownerFullName,
  'ownerEmail': ownerEmail,
  // ❌ Missing profileId
});
```

### **After (With profileId)**
```dart
detailedList.add({
  'passId': pass.passId,
  'profileId': profile?['id']?.toString(), // ✅ Added profileId
  'vehicleDescription': pass.vehicleDescription,
  // ... other fields
  'ownerFullName': ownerFullName,
  'ownerEmail': ownerEmail,
});
```
