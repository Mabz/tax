# Complete Database Schema Analysis & Fixes

## Great Progress! üéâ

From the debug logs, we can see the service is now working correctly:
- ‚úÖ **Real scan data found**: 16 scan records from 1 official
- ‚úÖ **Official ID identified**: `cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2`
- ‚úÖ **No more mock data**: Service is processing real data

## Final Schema Issue Fixed

### Problem:
```
PostgrestException: column authority_profiles.profile_picture_url does not exist
```

### Solution Applied:
Removed `profile_picture_url` from the authority_profiles query since it doesn't exist in the table.

## Actual Database Schema

Based on the errors, the `authority_profiles` table only has these columns:
```sql
CREATE TABLE authority_profiles (
  profile_id UUID,
  display_name TEXT,        -- ‚úÖ Available
  is_active BOOLEAN,        -- ‚úÖ Available  
  position TEXT,            -- ‚úÖ Available
  department TEXT           -- ‚úÖ Available
  -- email TEXT             -- ‚ùå Not available
  -- full_name TEXT         -- ‚ùå Not available
  -- profile_picture_url TEXT -- ‚ùå Not available
);
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Real scan data is being processed (16 records)
- Official IDs are being extracted from scan records
- No more database schema errors
- Service is using real data instead of mock data

### üîß Next Issue to Resolve:
The official name is still showing as "Border Official cbf0f0a4" because:
```
üë§ Processing official cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2: null
```

This means the profile data is `null`, which suggests:
1. The official exists in `pass_movements` but not in `authority_profiles`
2. OR the official exists in `profiles` but the query isn't finding them
3. OR there's still an issue with the data merging

## Expected Next Steps:

1. **Check if official exists in authority_profiles**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM authority_profiles 
   WHERE profile_id = 'cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2';
   ```

2. **Check if official exists in profiles**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles 
   WHERE id = 'cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2';
   ```

3. **If they exist in profiles but not authority_profiles**:
   - The service should fall back to `full_name` from profiles
   - This should resolve the name issue

## Progress Summary:
- ‚úÖ Fixed all database schema issues
- ‚úÖ Service now processes real scan data
- ‚úÖ Found 1 official with 16 scans (matches the UI!)
- üîß Need to resolve why profile data is null

We're very close to having everything working correctly!
