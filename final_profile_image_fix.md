# Final Profile Image Fix

## Problem Fixed
```
PostgrestException: column profiles.profile_picture_url does not exist
```

The column is actually called `profile_image_url` in the profiles table.

## Actual Profiles Table Schema
Based on the real data you provided:
```json
{
  "id": "cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2",
  "email": "bob@gmail.com", 
  "full_name": "Bob Miller",
  "profile_image_url": "https://cydtpwbgzilgrpozvesv.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/BorderTax/cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2/profile_image_1760358655670.jpg",
  "is_active": true,
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Query
**Before:**
```dart
.select('id, full_name, email, profile_picture_url, is_active')
```

**After:**
```dart
.select('id, full_name, email, profile_image_url, is_active')
```

### 2. Updated Data Mapping
**Before:**
```dart
'profile_picture_url': profile['profile_picture_url']
```

**After:**
```dart
'profile_image_url': profile['profile_image_url']
```

### 3. Updated Variable Assignment
**Before:**
```dart
final profilePictureUrl = profile?['profile_picture_url'];
```

**After:**
```dart
final profilePictureUrl = profile?['profile_image_url'];
```

## Expected Results

Now that we have the correct field name and Bobby's data:

### ‚úÖ Bobby Should Show:
- **Name**: "Bobby" (from authority_profiles.display_name)
- **Profile Picture**: His actual photo from the URL
- **Position**: "Trustee" (from authority_profiles.notes)
- **Email**: "bob@gmail.com" (from profiles.email)

### üîç Debug Analysis Expected:
The debug logs should now show:
```
üë§ Processing official cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2: {display_name: Bobby, notes: Trustee, ...}
üë§ Official name resolved to: Bobby
üë§ Official Bobby has 16 scans in the filtered dataset
üë§ Scan dates range: [date] to [date]
```

### üìä Scan Count Analysis:
The debug logs will reveal if Bobby's 16 scans:
- Are all within the 7-day period (then overview calculation needs fixing)
- Include both check-ins and check-outs (which might be expected)
- Span a longer time period (then individual filtering needs adjustment)

This should be the final fix! Bobby should now appear with his proper name, profile picture, and we'll understand the scan count discrepancy. üéâ
