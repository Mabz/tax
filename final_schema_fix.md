# Final Schema Fix: Correct Column Names

## Problem Identified
The service was querying for `position` and `department` columns that don't exist in the `authority_profiles` table.

## Actual Database Schema
Based on the real data you provided:
```json
{
  "profile_id": "cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2",
  "display_name": "Bobby",
  "is_active": true,
  "notes": "Trustee",
  "authority_id": "1c84f0eb-95e0-4aa4-b6ab-213c30af6595",
  "assigned_by": "cbf0f0a4-2d6d-4496-b944-f69c39aeecc2",
  "assigned_at": "2025-10-04 17:37:12.499329+00",
  "created_at": "2025-10-13 09:50:02.631975+00",
  "updated_at": "2025-10-13 13:14:16.286031+00"
}
```

## Final Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Query to Match Real Schema
**Before:**
```dart
.select('profile_id, display_name, is_active, position, department')
```

**After:**
```dart
.select('profile_id, display_name, is_active, notes')
```

### 2. Updated Data Mapping
**Before:**
```dart
'position': profile['position'],
'department': profile['department'],
```

**After:**
```dart
'notes': profile['notes'], // Use notes instead of position/department
```

### 3. Updated Official Creation
**Before:**
```dart
final position = profile?['position'];
final department = profile?['department'];
```

**After:**
```dart
final position = profile?['notes']; // Use notes as position/role
final department = null; // department not available
```

## Expected Results
Now that the query matches the actual database schema:

- âœ… **No more database errors** - All columns exist
- âœ… **"Bobby" should appear** - display_name will be found
- âœ… **Real scan counts** - 16 scans should match overview
- âœ… **Position shows as "Trustee"** - from the notes field
- âœ… **Complete official data** - All fields properly mapped

## Test Results Expected
After this fix, you should see:
- Official name: "Bobby" (instead of "Border Official cbf0f0a4")
- Position: "Trustee" (from notes field)
- Scan count: 16 (matching the overview)
- No more database errors in console

This should be the final fix needed to get the Border Officials working correctly! ðŸŽ‰
