WORKING IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:

✅ 1. FRIENDLY DATE FORMATTING
   - Updated the pass subtitle to use friendly dates
   - Shows "Today 2:30 PM", "Tomorrow 9:15 AM", etc.
   - Location: Line ~1869 in border_analytics_screen.dart
   - Change: date_utils.DateUtils.formatListDate() instead of _formatDate()

✅ 2. TAPPABLE PASSES FOR DETAILS
   - Added onTap to ListTile to show pass details
   - Location: Line ~1845 in border_analytics_screen.dart
   - Change: onTap: () => _showPassDetails(pass)

✅ 3. COMPREHENSIVE PASS DETAILS DIALOG
   - Created PassDetailsDialog widget with full pass information
   - Shows pass ID (copyable), vehicle info, schedule, status
   - Location: lib/widgets/pass_details_dialog.dart

✅ 4. DATE UTILITIES
   - Created comprehensive date formatting utilities
   - Multiple formats: friendly, list, relative time
   - Color coding based on date urgency
   - Location: lib/utils/date_utils.dart

✅ 5. HELPER METHODS FOR IMPROVED LAYOUT
   - Created _buildPassSection() method for separate check-in/out sections
   - Created _showPassDetails() and _showAllPasses() methods
   - Location: Lines 1064+ in border_analytics_screen.dart

PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:

⚠️ 6. SEPARATE CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT SECTIONS
   - The _buildPassSection() method is created but not yet used
   - Need to replace the _buildUpcomingPasses() method content
   - The improved method is available in lib/examples/improved_upcoming_passes_method.dart

⚠️ 7. PASS ID IN CORNER
   - Attempted but caused syntax issues with Stack
   - Can be added by wrapping ListTile content in Stack with Positioned widget

TO COMPLETE THE IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Replace the content of _buildUpcomingPasses() method with the improved version
2. Add pass ID badges using Stack and Positioned widgets
3. Test the complete functionality

CURRENT STATUS:
- Friendly dates: ✅ Working
- Tappable passes: ✅ Working  
- Pass details dialog: ✅ Working
- Separate sections: ⚠️ Method ready, needs integration
- Pass ID display: ⚠️ Needs Stack implementation
