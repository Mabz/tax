# Revenue Metrics Removal from Officials Performance

## Problem Identified
There was a logical inconsistency in revenue calculations:
- **Border Revenue (460)**: Calculated from actual pass purchases during the 7-day period
- **Official Revenue (1200)**: Incorrectly calculated from scans performed, which includes both check-ins AND check-outs

## Root Cause
Officials don't generate revenue by scanning passes - they only verify them. The revenue should only be attributed to the border/authority when passes are purchased, not when they're scanned.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Revenue Metrics from Officials Performance Cards
- ❌ Removed "Total Revenue" stat card
- ❌ Removed "Revenue Trend (Last 7 Days)" chart
- ✅ Added "Total Scans" stat card back for better context

### 2. Updated Officials Performance Layout
**Before:**
- Scans/Hour | Total Revenue | Avg Process Time

**After:**
- Total Scans | Scans/Hour | Avg Process Time

### 3. Service Layer Updates
- Removed `totalRevenue` field from `OfficialPerformance` model
- Removed `revenueTrend` field from `OfficialPerformance` model
- Removed `_generateRevenueTrend()` method
- Simplified mock data generation to only include scan trends

### 4. Data Model Cleanup
```dart
// REMOVED:
final double totalRevenue;
final List<ChartData> revenueTrend;

// KEPT:
final List<ChartData> scanTrend; // Still shows scan activity trends
```

## Result
- ✅ Eliminated confusing revenue discrepancies
- ✅ Officials now show only relevant metrics (scans, performance, processing time)
- ✅ Revenue metrics remain accurate at the border level (Analytics tab)
- ✅ Cleaner, more logical data presentation

## Metrics Now Shown for Officials
1. **Total Scans**: Number of passes scanned during selected period
2. **Scans/Hour**: Productivity rate compared to border average
3. **Avg Process Time**: Time taken per scan operation
4. **Scan Activity Trend**: 7-day chart showing daily scan counts

This provides a clear, accurate view of official performance without the misleading revenue calculations.
